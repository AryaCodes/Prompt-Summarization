you are given a array of numbers. we know distance between all pairs of neighboring indexes where distancei is sum of numbers between the index i and (i + 1) % n. you can count distance in both direction of indexesReturn the shortest distance between the given indexes. Also, you can traverse the array in both directionsExample 1:Input: distance = 1,2,3,4, start = 0, destination = 1Output: 1Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1. Example 2:Input: distance = 1,2,3,4, start = 0, destination = 2Output: 3Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3. Example 3:Input: distance = 1,2,3,4, start = 0, destination = 3Output: 4Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4. Constraints:1 <= n <= 10^4distance.length == n0 <= start, destination < n0 <= distancei <= 10^4
