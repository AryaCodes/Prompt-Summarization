We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).  Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.Example 1:Input: bits = 1, 0, 0Output: TrueExplanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.Example 2:Input: bits = 1, 1, 1, 0Output: FalseExplanation: The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.Note:1 .bitsi is always 0 or 1.
