you are given an array of numbers. Find the minimum number of indexes in the array need to be reordered such that all the elements in array are in non-decreasing order Example 1:Input: heights = 1,1,4,2,1,3Output: 3Explanation: Current array : 1,1,4,2,1,3Target array  : 1,1,1,2,3,4On index 2 we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this element.On index 4 we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this element.On index 5 we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this element.Example 2:Input: heights = 5,1,2,3,4Output: 5Example 3:Input: heights = 1,2,3,4,5Output: 0Â Constraints:1 <= heights.length <= 1001 <= heightsi <= 100
