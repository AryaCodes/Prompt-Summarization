# Prompt-Summarization
Using NLP techniques to summarize prompts for program synthesis.
## Motivation
We know GPT3, and similar models, are exceeding at many NLP tasks. Recently, researchers and companies have been focusing on probram synthesis.
Which is the task of given the model a prompt and asking it to generate code to solve that prompt. There has been small success when the prompts
are small and self contained. However, the models struggle with longer prompts. We hope to solve this problem by summarizing long prompts so we can
obtain the same performance on complex problems as we do on shorter problems.
