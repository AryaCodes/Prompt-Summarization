You have $n$ nodes in a graph. The $i$-th node starts with a value of $i$.The node values will be revised $q$ times. For the $j$-th revision, node $v_i$ will have a value of $n+i$.The node $v_i$ will have this value for the only the $j$-th revision,it will have value $i$ otherwise.Some nodes dislike with each other, if two nodes $a$ and $b$ dislike with each other and $a$ has a higher value than $b$ then $a$ conflicts with $b$.A dangerous triple is three nodes $a$, $b$, $c$ such that $a$ conflicts with $b$ and $b$ conflicts with $c$.You need to find the number of dangerous triples before the revisions and after each revision.Input:The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $0\le m \le 100\,000$) — the number of nodes and the number of nodes that dislike each other. Each of the following $m$ linescontains two integers $a_i$, $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$, $a_i \neq b_i$)denoting that node $a_i$ and $b_i$ dislike each other. The next line contains an integer $q$ ($0 \le q \le 100\,000$) — the number of revisions. The $i$-th of the following $q$ lines contains a singleinteger $v_i$ ($1 \le v_i \le n$) denoting that at the end of the $i$-th day,node $v_i$ will have the highest value. Output:Output $q + 1$ integers. The $i$-th of them should contain the number of dangerous triples on the $i$-th revision.Examples:Input4 51 22 41 33 42 3223Output432Input3 31 22 31 3512213Output111111
