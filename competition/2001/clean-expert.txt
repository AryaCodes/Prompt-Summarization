You are given two integers X and d.You should construct an array such that, removing all non-empty subsequences in which Maximum_element_of_the_subsequence  -  Minimum_element_of_subsequence  ≥ d from the set of allsubsequences will give you X subsequences.Input:The only line of input consists of two space separated integers X and d (1 ≤ X, d ≤ 10^9).Output:Output should consist of two lines.First line should contain a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000)— the number of integers in the final array.Second line should consist of n space separated integers — a_1, a_2, ... , a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} < 10^18).If there is no answer, print a single integer -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.Examples:Input10 5Output65 50 7 15 6 100Input4 2Output410 100 1000 10000
