You are given grid of size $a \times b$ and a coordinate $(x, y)$ within that grid.

The columns are numbered from $0$ to $a-1$, and rows from $0$ to $b-1$.

First, find the maximum length, $l$, betweeen $x$ and $a - 1 - x$.
Next, find the maximum height, $h$, between $y$ and $b - 1 - y$.
Finally, find the maximum area between a rectangle of height $b$ and length $l$ or length $a$ and height $h$.


-----Input-----

In the first line you are given an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the
number of test cases in the test. In the next lines you are given descriptions
of $t$ test cases.

Each test case contains a single line which consists of $4$ integers $a, b, x$
and $y$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^4$; $0 \le x < a$; $0 \le y < b$) — the size of the
grid and the coordinate. It is guaranteed that $a+b>2$.


-----Output-----

Print $t$ integers — the answers for each test case. Each answer should contain
an integer equal to the maximal possible area of a rectangular, that doesn't
contain the coordinate.
