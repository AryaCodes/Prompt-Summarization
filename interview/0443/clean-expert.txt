Each should have numbers in ascending or descending orderReturn the number of such sets that can be formed. a number can be in multiple sets Example 1:Input: rating = 2,5,3,4,1Output: 3Explanation: We can form three sets given the conditions. (2,3,4), (5,4,1), (5,3,1). Example 2:Input: rating = 2,1,3Output: 0Explanation: We can't form any set given the conditions.Example 3:Input: rating = 1,2,3,4Output: 4 Constraints:n == rating.length1 <= n <= 2001 <= ratingi <= 10^5
