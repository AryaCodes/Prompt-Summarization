Given an 2 dimentional array count number of specific structures in it. Structures are represented by 'X's and empty slots are represented with "."s. You may assume the following rules:You receive a valid 2 dimentional array, made of only structures or empty slots.Structures can only be horizontal or vertical. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1 row, N column or N rows, 1 column. Where N can be of any size.At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two structures - there are no adjacent structures.Example:X..X...X...XIn the above 2 dimentional array there are 2 structures.Invalid Example:...XXXXX...XThis is an invalid 2 dimentional arry that you will not receive - as structures will always have a cell separating between them.Follow up:Could you do it in one-pass, using only O(1) extra memory and without modifying the value of the board?
