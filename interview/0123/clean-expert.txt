You are given N different numbers you want to make combinations of L different numbers. Create combinations so that:every number is used atleast oncea number can only be repeated only if K other numbers have been usedReturn the number of possible combinations. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.Example 1:Input: N = 3, L = 3, K = 1Output: 6Explanation: There are 6 possible combinations. 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1.Example 2:Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 0Output: 6Explanation: There are 6 possible combinations. 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2Example 3:Input: N = 2, L = 3, K = 1Output: 2Explanation: There are 2 possible combinations. 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2Â Note:0 <= K < N <= L <= 100
